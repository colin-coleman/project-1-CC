            <p>FC Barcelona was founded in 1899 in the city of Barcelona, Spain. Joan Gamper formed the club and it went through ups and downs until <em>Johan Cruyff</em> took over and made Barcelona the club it is today. He focused on the youth like one of his former clubs Ajax did and La Masia was formed. Many legends of the club have come through La Masia and it is now one of the most prominent football academies in the world. Cruyff was also an inspiration and the coach of former Barcelona player and coach, <em> Pep Guardiola </em>. Guardiola taught the idea of “Tiki Taka” which focused on quick passing and movement of the ball which would give Barcelona possession of the ball more. This became the identity of the club and with players like <em> Lionel Messi </em>, the club would only see more success for years to come. <br>
               Lionel Messi is the most capped player in the history of the club and has the most goals and assists in the clubs history.
