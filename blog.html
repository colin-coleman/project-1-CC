    <h2>Barcelona vs Villareal Preview</h2>
    <p>The teams next match is this Saturday, February 28th, where they take on Villareal at home. Barcelona are going to want to get a 2nd win in a row which would extend their lead of Real Madrid for the top of the league. This won’t be an easy match for the <em> Culers </em> as Villarreal have won their last two matches and sit third in the league behind Real Madrid. They last played on December 21, 2025 where a <strong> Raphina </strong> penalty and a <strong>Lamine Yamal </strong> goal would seal a 2-0 win away. <strong> Gerard Martin </strong> will be unavailable due to a suspension from accumulating too many yellow cards. </p>
